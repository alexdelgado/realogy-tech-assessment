# Realogy Tech Assessment

A simple "To-Do List" application built with [Angular (v5.2.10)](https://angular.io/docs), [Bootstrap (v4.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/), and [Async local storage for Angular (v0.7.1)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-pwa/local-storage).

The requirements were to build a simple "To-Do List" application using Angular. I chose Bootstrap mainly for the responsive grid and basic styling. I utilized the local storage library to handle the differences in browsers and APIs.

**Note:** This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
